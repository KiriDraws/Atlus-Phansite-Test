        <p>Release date: 10 July 2008</p>
        <p>
            Persona 4, released outside Japan as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4, 
            is a 2008 role-playing video game by Atlus. It is chronologically the fifth installment in the Persona series, 
            itself a part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The plot of Persona 4 was inspired by the work of mystery novelists owing to its murder mystery premise. 
            The rural setting was based on a town on the outskirts of Mount Fuji and intended as a "'nowhere' place" and is the central setting to have 
            players sympathize with the daily life of the characters. The developers added many in-game events to prevent the game from becoming stale. 
            During localization, numerous alterations to Japanese cultural references were made to preserve the effect as much as possible. 
            The release of Persona 4 in Japan was accompanied by merchandise such as character costumes and accessories. 
            The game's music was primarily composed by Shoji Meguro, with vocals performed by Shihoko Hirata. The North American and European releases came with a soundtrack CD with selected music from the game.

            Set in modern-day Tokyo and the Netherworld, The protagonist, an ordinary high-school student, and his school friends Yuzuru Atsuta 
            and Ichiro Dazai are caught up in a mysterious earthquake and transported to Da'at; an alternative apocalyptic version of Tokyo amidst 
            an almighty battle between angels and demons. As he travels in this world, he shortly becomes overrun by demons and is nearly killed, 
            only to be saved by a god-like being, Aogami. Together, they fuse into a Nahobino, a forbidden being that is neither human nor demon, 
            but more so a deity. The protagonist traverses Da'at, clashes with a man named Shohei Yakumo and his demon partner Nuwa, and discovers 
            a terminal that returns him and his friends to Tokyo. There, he learns that Yuzuru and his classmate Tao Isonokami are actually operatives of an 
            international clandestine organization called Bethel focused on keeping humanity out of the war between angels and demons. 
            Ichiro volunteers to join Bethel while the protagonist is conscripted due to his newfound powers as a Nahobino.
